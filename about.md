We are engineers, developers and scientists working to answer
questions that have been with humankind since before civilization: how
will we produce enough calories for us all to not just survive, but
thrive? How will we grow the fiber that will clothe us? Can we convert
solar energy into the fuel that powers our machines? Monsanto is
powered by adaptation and innovation; we have a long history as a
cutting-edge science company that has produced everything from
chemicals, to plastics, and even medicines.

Now we are focused purely on agriculture and problems that have
plagued farmers for hundreds of generations. We are bringing the
science and technology of computer vision, predictive analytics, and
petabyte scale DNA sequencing to predict and adapt to climate change,
cut down on waste, and engineer plants resistant to insects and
fungi. These are advances that are helping move the entire world
forward, and we want to share what we are doing.

This is a journey, starting with open source. Weâ€™re committed to open
sourcing as much of our internal code as possible, and along with
that, we want to share both elegant solutions we have developed and
challenges we are facing. We will speak candidly on this blog, and we
hope that you will join us as we share what it is like to work on the
software driving this company forward.

To find out more about what we are working on, we invite you to
[Discover Monsanto](http://discover.monsanto.com/) and be part of the
conversation. You can also find exciting career opportunities by visiting our [Careers](/careers/) section.
